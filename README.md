# Kirstens Kook Creaties

KirstensKookCreaties is a collection of my personal recipes and also my first ever website project. It's a static site built using Hugo and HTML/CSS and hosted through Github Pages. I also incorporated some dynamic features with Javascript, such as a 'surprise me' button and a search panel.
